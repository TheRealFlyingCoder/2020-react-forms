# TheFlyingCoder's 2020 React Forms Accelerator

This package is an extension of my [2020 React Accelerator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/2020-react), so for
all the information about the tooling check out the readme there!

Try try this package out using my npx installer:

`npx 2020-react-forms <project-name>`

[Check it out on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/2020-react-forms)

**React Hook Form**  

The foundation of forms for me lately comes from the [react hook form package](https://react-hook-form.com/).

Lightweight, no dependencies outside of React and lot of flexibility, you can do pretty much anything. This
package is just one way i've utilised the tooling, but it's by no means great for every use case.
